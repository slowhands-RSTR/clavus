## Edge Cases & Error Handling

| # | Test | macOS | Windows | Notes |
|---|------|:---:|:---:|-------|

| E10 | `clavus share` port conflict → clear error | 🔲 | 🔲 | |

## Platform-Specific

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|------|:---:|-------|
| P1 | Windows: TUI renders correctly (Windows Terminal) | ✅ 5/11 | |
| P2 | Windows: `os.startfile()` opens .als in Ableton | 🔲 | |
| P3 | Windows: OneDrive Files On-Demand → .als accessible | 🔲 | |
| P4 | Windows: `py -m pip install -e .` works from fresh clone | 🔲 | |
| P5 | macOS: `open` command launches Ableton | ✅ 5/10 | |
| P6 | macOS: `tailscale serve` survives sleep/wake | 🔲 | |
| P7 | Linux: install + `clavus tui` runs (no DAW needed) | 🔲 | |
| P8 | Cross-platform: Mac snapshot → Windows restore → opens in Ableton | 🔲 | |
| P9 | Cross-platform: Windows snapshot → Mac restore → opens in Ableton | 🔲 | |

## Test Sessions

| Date | Who | Platform | Tests run | Results |
|------|-----|----------|-----------|---------|
| 5/10/26 | Chris + Hermes | macOS | T1-T5, T8-T19, T21-T23, L2-L3, L12, P5 | 25+ ✅. Bugs fixed: assign/unassign fingerprint, missing Path import, 10-char hash → full_hash in diff, 📸→● emoji purge, ⧩ logo restored, inject→auto-snapshot, freeze soft warning, archive/delete prefill. Spinner animation fixed. |
| 5/11/26 | Chris + Hermes | macOS | :projects picker, :remotes picker, L5 (join), E1 (no .als), L4 (share relay) | :projects j/k/enter switcher done. :remotes picker + per-project remote scoping. :browse scrapped — Finder paste + :init faster. :init now strips quotes/tilde/Finder paste. Push/pull uses single active remote per project. 7+ crashes fixed (debounce, fingerprint, stale index on pickers, sync_url compat). 43 total ✅. |
| 5/11/26 | Chris + Hermes | Windows | T1, T3, T12, T13, T15, T18, T25-T28, P1 | Windows TUI confirmed: c, S, p, P, j/k, :project, :projects, :remotes, :inject, :push! all working. Force push deadlock fixed — relay now updates HEAD on force push even when snapshots already exist. F binding removed, :push! is break-glass command-only. |

**Legend:** ✅ Pass  ❌ Fail  ⚠️ Flake / intermittent  🔲 Untested

**How to use:** Before a release, run through 🔲 items. Mark ✅/❌ with date. File bugs for ❌. After each test session, add a row to Test Sessions.
