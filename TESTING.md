## Collaboration (two-machine)

| # | Test | Mac↔Win | Win↔Win | Mac↔Mac | Notes |
|---|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|-------|
| C1 | Push snapshots → peer pulls | ✅ 5/11 | 🔲 | 🔲 | |
| C2 | Peer pushes → you pull | ✅ 5/11 | 🔲 | 🔲 | |

## TUI

| # | Test | macOS | Windows | Notes |

| T16 | `?` help screen (all bindings visible) | ✅ 5/10 | ✅ 5/11 | |
| T17 | `:` command mode → `:snapshot msg`, `:pull`, `:push` | ✅ 5/10 | ✅ 5/11 | |
| T18 | `:project <name>` switch projects → cues/history reload | ✅ 5/10 | ✅ 5/11 | |
| T19 | `:init <path>` from TUI → project loads | ✅ 5/10 | ✅ 5/11 | |
| ~~T20~~ | ~~`:browse`~~ | ~~removed~~ | ~~removed~~ | Scrapped — Finder paste + `:init` is faster |
| T21 | Header dot: green ● (connected), yellow ○ (remote, no data), dim ○ (no remote) | ✅ 5/10 | ✅ 5/11 | |
| T22 | Freeze detection warning on `S` | ✅ 5/10 | ✅ 5/11 | :freeze toggle — warn (default) or block |
| T23 | Long cue text / snapshot message → no truncation crash | ✅ 5/10 | ✅ 5/11 | |
| T24 | TUI survives corrupt meta file (orphaned 10-char hash) | ✅ 5/11 | 🔲 | Cycle detection + missing snap + self-referencing parent guards |
| T25 | `:projects` picker — j/k navigate, enter select, esc cancel | ✅ 5/11 | ✅ 5/11 | |
| T26 | `:remotes` picker — per-project remote scoping | ✅ 5/11 | ✅ 5/11 | Push/pull uses selected remote only |
| T27 | `:inject` → cues land as Ableton markers → auto-snapshot | ✅ 5/11 | ✅ 5/11 | |
| T28 | `:push!` force push — skips lock, overwrites relay HEAD | ✅ 5/11 | ✅ 5/11 | Fixed 5/11 eve: was async without @work — never executed |
| T29 | `:pull-all` — pull all projects from active remote | ✅ 5/11 Mac | ✅ 5/11 Win | Fixed: parsing bug — "pull all" hit subprocess branch instead of _run_pull_all |

## Test Sessions

| Date | Who | Platform | Tests run | Results |
|------|-----|----------|-----------|---------|
| 5/10/26 | Chris + Hermes | macOS | T1-T5, T8-T19, T21-T23, L2-L3, L12, P5 | 25+ ✅. Bugs fixed: assign/unassign fingerprint, missing Path import, 10-char hash → full_hash in diff, 📸→● emoji purge, ⧩ logo restored, inject→auto-snapshot, freeze soft warning, archive/delete prefill. Spinner animation fixed. |
| 5/11/26 | Chris + Hermes | macOS | :projects picker, :remotes picker, L5 (join), E1 (no .als), L4 (share relay) | :projects j/k/enter switcher done. :remotes picker + per-project remote scoping. :browse scrapped — Finder paste + :init faster. :init now strips quotes/tilde/Finder paste. Push/pull uses single active remote per project. 7+ crashes fixed (debounce, fingerprint, stale index on pickers, sync_url compat). 43 total ✅. |
| 5/11/26 | Chris + Hermes | Windows | T1, T3, T12, T13, T15, T18, T25-T28, P1 | Windows TUI confirmed: c, S, p, P, j/k, :project, :projects, :remotes, :inject, :push! all working. Force push deadlock fixed — relay now updates HEAD on force push even when snapshots already exist. F binding removed, :push! is break-glass command-only. |
| 5/11/26 eve | Chris + Hermes | Mac+Win | :pull-all, :push!, push conflict bugs | **:push! was never executing** — `async` without `@work`, same bug as :pull-all. Fixed. **Cross-project push conflicts** — `last_head` was per-remote global, switching projects caused 409. Fixed: `ClavusProject.last_remote_head`. **:pull-all error invisible on Windows** — 6 attempted fixes (30s timer, sentinel, _sticky_error, direct widget.write, forced refresh). Root cause appears to be CSS `display:none` still active when @work worker writes to #footer-status. Error text lands in hidden widget. Needs modal/log-file approach. 7 commits. |
| 5/11/26 night | Chris + Hermes | Mac+Win | H1-H2 hardening, C1-C4, C7-C8 collaboration | **Hardening branch tested.** --debug flag + errors.log confirmed. **3 pull bugs fixed:** welcome autoload, root_als gate, global HEAD ref blocking per-project heads. 4 commits merged to main. **Collaboration validated:** Mac↔Win push/pull, cue conflict ⚠ + ! resolution, cross-machine `o` open, `T` restore all ✅. Suite/Intro .als incompatibility is Ableton-side, not Clavus. |

**Legend:** ✅ Pass  ❌ Fail  ⚠️ Flake / intermittent  🔲 Untested

**How to use:** Before a release, run through 🔲 items. Mark ✅/❌ with date. File bugs for ❌. After each test session, add a row to Test Sessions.
