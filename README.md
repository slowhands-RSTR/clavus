# Clavus — Version Control for Ableton Live

Snapshots, cues, and sync for your Ableton projects. No cloud. No plugins. No accounts.

- **Solo** — save checkpoints, diff what changed, restore any version in one keypress
- **Together** — push snapshots to a shared relay, pull your collaborator's changes, resolve conflicts cleanly
- **Cross-platform** — Mac ↔ Windows, studio ↔ home, works with Tailscale or LAN

```

One person runs the relay (`clavus share`). Others connect (`clavus join`), push snapshots up, pull changes down. No cloud.

**The relay runs on someone's machine.** When that machine goes to sleep or shuts down, the relay goes with it. Push and pull only work when the relay is reachable. This is not a cloud service — there's no always-on server unless you put the relay on one (a VPS, a Raspberry Pi, an old laptop that stays on).

> **Status: early but active.** Clavus came together through late nights and real studio sessions — a small team of producers who needed this to exist, building and testing it across Mac and Windows between sessions. The TUI is functional, not beautiful, and you may hit rough edges. We fix bugs quickly and iterate constantly. See [Contributing](#contributing) below.

## What You Get

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| **Snapshots** | `S` — saves a content-addressed checkpoint with the full `.als` file, parent chain, and integrity verification |
| **Timeline cues** | `c` — pinned comments at specific bars/beats; inject as Ableton markers |
| **Push / Pull** | `P` / `p` — sync snapshots and cues through a relay |
| **Stem sync** | `U` — upload/download WAV stems through the relay |
| **Conflict resolution** | ⚠ warns when both sides edited the same thing; `!` to pick whose |
| **Restore** | `T` — roll back to any previous snapshot |
| **Diff** | `d` — see exactly what changed between snapshots (tracks, devices, clips) |
| **Backup** | `clavus backup` — full store archive with auto-rotating index backups |
| **Health check** | `clavus doctor` — read-only store integrity check and diagnostics |

**Platform:** macOS, Windows · **DAW:** Ableton Live 11+ (Suite/Standard/Intro)  
**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download) (free tier)

---

## Quick Install

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download) (free tier). Takes about 2 minutes.

```bash
# 1. Grab the code
git clone https://github.com/castle-queenside/clavus
cd clavus

# 2. Install
pip install -e .          
# Windows: py -m pip install -e .

# 3. Add a project and open the dashboard
clavus init /path/to/your/project.als
clavus tui
```

> **Why Tailscale?** It creates a secure, private network between you and your collaborators without configuring routers or firewalls. Install it, sign in with any account (Google, GitHub, etc.), and Clavus picks it up automatically.

Press `S` to snapshot, `c` to add a cue, `T` to restore. Full walkthrough below.

---

## Starting a Project

### Solo — Import an existing Ableton project

```bash
clavus init /path/to/your/project.als
clavus tui
```

Now press `S` to snapshot whenever you've made changes worth keeping. Press `T` to restore any previous snapshot. Press `d` to diff two snapshots.

### Solo — Daily workflow

```
clavus tui          # open dashboard
p                   # pull latest (nothing to pull solo, but good habit)
... work in Ableton ...
S                   # snapshot — saves a checkpoint
```

### With a Collaborator — One person hosts

The collaborator who wants to share chooses a port (e.g. 7891) and runs the relay:

```bash
# Start the relay (keeps running; use a separate terminal window)
clavus share --port 7891

# Check it's live
curl http://localhost:7891/api/ping
# → {"status":"ok"}
```

Share your Tailscale URL with your collaborator. Clavus prints it when the relay starts — it looks like `http://your-machine.tailXXXX.ts.net:7891`.

> **Cross-account?** If you and your collaborator use different Tailscale accounts, go to [admin.tailscale.com](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) → your machine → Share → their email. They must accept the invite before they can connect. Raw `100.x.x.x` IPs are blocked between different Tailscale accounts.

> **If you want to use port 80/443** (cleaner URL, no port number), Tailscale can proxy:
> `tailscale serve --bg --http 80 http://localhost:7891`
> This is optional. The direct port works fine.

### With a Collaborator — Everyone else joins

```bash
# Paste the URL your collaborator sent you (use the same port they chose)
clavus join http://their-name.tailXXXX.ts.net:7891

# Pull all their projects
clavus pull

# Open the dashboard
clavus tui
```

That's it. Clavus shows you everything they have available.

## What It Looks Like

![Clavus TUI dashboard with cues and snapshot history](docs/screenshots/tui-main.jpg)

Dashboard with cue list (left) and snapshot history (right).

![Clavus diff viewer showing track-level changes](docs/screenshots/tui-diff.jpg)

Diff view: see exactly what changed between snapshots — tracks added, devices changed, clips moved.

---

## Daily Collaboration Workflow

Open the dashboard:
```bash
clavus tui
```

Then each session:
```
p          → pull your collaborator's latest changes (your work is auto-snapshotted first)
... work in Ableton ...
S          → save a snapshot of your work
P          → push your changes to the relay
```

Your collaborator does the same from their machine. Whoever runs the relay needs to leave it running for push/pull to work. If you're both working on a session, pick whose machine stays on. If you want the relay available 24/7, put it on an always-on machine (a VPS, a Raspberry Pi, an old laptop).

### Adding timeline comments (cues)

Press `c`, type your note, and optionally add a position like `@1:23` (bar 1, beat 3) or `@3:45:20` (minutes:seconds:frames). When your collaborator runs `:inject`, those cues appear as markers inside Ableton at the right position.

```
c          → new cue
e          → edit selected cue
r          → reply to selected cue
a          → assign cue to a collaborator
R          → mark cue resolved / unresolved
!          → resolve a sync conflict (both edited same cue)
```

### Opening a project in Ableton

Press `o` — Clavus opens the latest synced version in Ableton Live. Press `o` while a snapshot is selected in the history pane to open that specific version.

### Inject cues as Ableton markers

Press `:` then type `inject`. Clavus adds your cue comments as named markers in the Ableton arrangement at each cue's timestamp.

## If Something Goes Wrong

### "HEAD has moved — pull first"
Someone pushed while you were working. Your work is safe — Clavus auto-snapshotted it. Press `p` to pull their changes, then press `P` to push yours.

### "⚠ on a cue or snapshot"
Both of you edited the same thing simultaneously. Press `!` and pick **yours** or **theirs**.

### "Connection refused" / "Cannot reach relay"
- Is the host still running `clavus share`?
- Is Tailscale running? Run `tailscale status` to check.
- If you're on different Tailscale accounts: did the host share their machine with you at [admin.tailscale.com](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines)? You must accept the invite.

### "Nothing shows up — no project"
You haven't added the project yet. Run `clavus join <url>` to connect to the relay, then `p` to pull the project. Or add one manually with `clavus init /path/to/project.als`.

### "Frozen track warning"
Ableton Live crashes when opening projects with frozen tracks from a different OS. When you see this warning, unfreeze the tracks in Ableton before snapshotting, or press `S` with `--allow-frozen` if everyone is on the same OS.

### "404 on install.ps1" (Windows)
GitHub's CDN sometimes takes a few minutes to pick up newly pushed files. If `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../install.ps1 | iex` fails, use the git clone approach instead:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/castle-queenside/clavus
cd clavus
py -m pip install -e .
clavus setup
```

---

## Updating Clavus

```bash
cd clavus
git pull
pip install -e .     # Windows: py -m pip install -e .
```

---

## Known Limitations

**Ableton Suite vs Intro/Standard:** Clavus snapshots the raw `.als` file. Suite-only features are preserved but Intro/Standard can't decode them. Always verify a restored `.als` opens before deleting the original.

**OneDrive / Files On-Demand:** Ableton has trouble with `.als` files in OneDrive-synced folders. Keep projects on a local drive.

**Single relay at a time:** `clavus join` replaces any existing remote. Your snapshots and history stay local regardless.

**No two-person-at-once push protection:** Simultaneous pushes may get a 409. Clavus handles it gracefully — pull first, then push again.
