# Clavus — Collaborator Quickstart

**You got a link from a producer. Here's what to do.**

---

## Before You Start

You need three things:

1. **Tailscale** installed — this is how your computer talks to theirs securely
2. **Clavus** installed — the collaboration tool
3. The URL from your collaborator (something like `http://chris.tailxxxxx.ts.net:7890`)

No accounts. No cloud. Just these three things.

---

## Step 1: Install Tailscale (5 minutes, one-time)

Go to [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download) and download the installer for your OS.

- **Mac:** Open the `.pkg` and click through. It'll appear in your menu bar.
- **Windows:** Run the `.msi` installer. It'll appear in your system tray.

Open Tailscale and sign in with a Google/Microsoft/GitHub account. Free tier is fine — that's what everyone uses.

> **⚠️ Cross-account note:** If you and the host use different Tailscale accounts, the host needs to share their machine with you. They do this at [admin.tailscale.com](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) → their machine → Share → your email. You'll get an invite. Accept it.

---

## Step 2: Install Clavus (one-time)

Open **Terminal** (Mac) or **Windows Terminal / PowerShell** (Windows).

Paste these lines one at a time, pressing Enter after each:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/castle-queenside/clavus
cd clavus
```

**Mac:**
```bash
pip3 install -e .
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
py -m pip install -e .
```

Then run the setup wizard:
```bash
clavus setup
```

It'll ask your name and a couple preferences. Just press Enter for defaults.

---

## Step 3: Join the Session

Run this in the terminal, using the URL your collaborator sent:

```bash
clavus join http://chris.tailxxxxx.ts.net:7890
```

You'll see something like:

```

## Step 5: Daily Workflow

Here's what you do in a normal session:

| Step | Key | What it does |
|------|-----|-------------|
| 1. Start | `clavus tui` | Open the dashboard |
| 2. Pull latest | `p` | Get your collaborator's changes (auto-saves your work first) |
| 3. Work in Ableton | (switch to Live) | Make your changes |
| 4. Snapshot | `S` | Save a checkpoint of what you've done |
| 5. Push | `P` | Send your changes to your collaborator |

That's it. `p` → work → `S` → `P`.

### Adding cues (timeline comments)

Press `c`, type your note, add a position like `@1:23`. These appear as markers in Ableton after the host runs `:inject`.

### Replying to cues

Arrow keys to select a cue, press `r`, type your reply.

### Opening the project in Ableton

Press `o` — Clavus opens the latest version of the `.als` in Ableton Live.

---

## Keybindings Reference

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `c` | New cue (timeline comment) |
| `S` | Snapshot (save checkpoint) |
| `p` | Pull latest from collaborator |
| `P` | Push your changes |
| `r` | Reply to selected cue |
| `e` | Edit cue or snapshot message |
| `a` | Assign cue to someone |
| `R` | Resolve / unresolve cue |
| `!` | Resolve sync conflict |
| `T` | Restore to snapshot |
| `d` | Diff (see what changed) |
| `o` | Open project in Ableton |
| `Tab` | Switch between cues / history |
| `j` / `k` | Move up / down |
| `:` | Command mode (type commands) |
| `?` | Help screen |
| `q` | Quit |

---

## Common Commands

Type `:` then the command:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `:pull` | Pull latest changes |
| `:push` | Push your changes |
| `:push!` | Force push (overwrite — use only if told to) |
| `:snapshot message` | Snapshot with a message |
| `:inject` | Inject cues as Ableton markers |
| `:project name` | Switch to a different project |
| `:projects` | Pick from a list of projects |
| `:remotes` | Manage connection targets |

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection refused" or "Cannot reach"**
- Is the host running `clavus share`?
- Is Tailscale running? Check with `tailscale status`
- If cross-account: did the host share their machine with you?

**"HEAD has moved — pull first"**
Someone pushed while you were working. Press `p` (your work is auto-saved), then push again.

**"⚠" on a cue or snapshot**
Both of you edited the same thing. Press `!` to pick which version to keep.

**Nothing happens when I press `o` to open Ableton**
Ableton wasn't auto-detected. The sync still works fine — just open the `.als` file manually from your Clavus projects folder.

**How do I update Clavus?**
```bash
cd clavus
git pull
pip install -e .    # (Windows: py -m pip install -e .)
```

## Need Help?

Ask your collaborator. They're the host — they can see the relay status and diagnose connection issues. If something's broken on your end, the error messages are designed to tell you exactly what to fix.
